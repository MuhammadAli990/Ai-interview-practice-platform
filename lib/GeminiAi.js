    - If the candidate has **less experience**, the questions should be easier.
    - If the candidate has **more experience**, the questions should be more challenging and should require more in-depth answers.

    The questions should focus on the **job description** and **job position** while reflecting the **candidate's experience level**.

    Job Description: ${jobDescription}
    Job Experience: ${jobExperience} years
    Job Position: ${jobPosition}

    Please generate 5 interview questions that are **easier to some what harder** based on the years of experience provided. Each question should be relevant to the job position and description, ensuring that the difficulty increases with experience.

    The questions should be phrased as if the interviewer is asking the candidate face-to-face in a real-time interview (like Google Meet or a real interview), with the candidate answering in real time â€” no practical to do questions, just conversational questions.

    No compliments like great,wow,excellent etc. You can use words like "hi" or "welcome" etc in 1st question and words like "finally" or "at last" etc in last question.

    Return only the 5 questions in the json format:`
